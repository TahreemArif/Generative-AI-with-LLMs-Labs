# Generative AI with LLMs
This repository contains labs and resources for the "Generative AI with LLMs" course offered on Coursera.

## Labs Overview

### Lab 1: Dialogue Summarization using LLMs
This lab introduces the concept of prompt engineering with LLMs to effectively summarize dialogues.

### Lab 2: Fine-Tune FLAN-T5 for Dialogue Summarization
In this lab, I fine-tune the FLAN-T5 model using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). The focus is on adapting the model to produce more accurate dialogue summaries.

### Lab 3: Fine-Tune FLAN-T5 with Reinforcement Learning and PEFT
This lab advances the fine-tuning process by incorporating Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) alongside PEFT to generate less-toxic summaries, enhancing the model's usability in real-world applications.
